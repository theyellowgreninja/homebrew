# homebrew
Homebrew to be imported and used in 5e.tools
Personal stuff - races and spells mostly (probably) that I plan on having in my own campaign.
Not really a whole reqork of all of 5e or anything like that.  I just wanted the option to curse my players with being Half-Undead (and be able to see the stats in 5e tools)
